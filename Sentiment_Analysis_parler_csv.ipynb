If something doesn‚Äôt happen soon , which is likely not going to, we are going to fight ,EACH OTHER.PLAN: for those of you that live in a predominantly blue area and still believe in America, reach out to friends or family that will take you in temporarily. Plan to make it there when this situation worsens.  Take some of your savings and buy dry-foods. Learn how to filter water.  Buy extra meds like ibuprofen and such. Buy a hand crank radio, flashlight, USB charger.I‚Äôve held the idea for months that this is going to be over and we‚Äôll prevail in courts but our own elected officials have sided with globalism. Very Scary INDEED!! Be vigilant and take note of who our enemies are now. You know some , I do as well. Prepare, Pray, and Accept. War is upon our doorstep!Good luck!!\n",
